# README

This repository is meant to support two separate manuscripts:

1. [Plant spectra as integrative measures of plant phenotypes](https://ecoevorxiv.org/bfc5t/) by Kothari & Schweiger (2022), _EcoEvoRxiv_ DOI: 10.32942/osf.io/bfc5t (in press at _Journal of Ecology_)
2. [Predicting leaf traits across functional groups using reflectance spectroscopy](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.07.01.498461v2) by Kothari et al. 2022 DOI: 10.1101/2022.07.01.498461

The repository is maintained by Shan Kothari (shan.kothari@umontreal.ca). The current version of the repository is being archived at Zenodo (DOI forthcoming) and is meant to represent the analyses carried out in the version of manuscript (1) that will appear in _Journal of Ecology_. The code base may change further before manuscript (2) is published in the journal.

## How to use

This repository is *not* a software package or any sort of user-oriented product that people can use without further modification. It *is* meant to be a reasonably well-documented and faithful record of the analyses carried out in the two manuscripts listed above.
